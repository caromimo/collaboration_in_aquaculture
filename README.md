# Scientific Collaboration through the lens of Social Network Analysis

This is a personal project to learn about Social Network Analysis. To do
so, data was extracted from the 2015 Canadian Aquaculture Research and
Development Review to visualise the network of Canadian Aquaculture
Research and Development.

This repo includes:

* The PDF from which the data was extracted (2015_review.pdf)
* The yaml files in which the data was saved (2015_review.yml)
* A python script to extract the edges between organisations working
collaboratively on a project (generate_edge_list)
* The csv file that gets generated by the Python script
(2015_review_edge_list.csv)
* A presentation providing an overview of the projet and highlighting some
results and interpretation (index.html)

The presentation is visible [here](https://caromimo.github.io/collaboration_in_aquaculture/#1).

To explore the data and the script: 
```bash
git@github.com:caromimo/collaboration_in_aquaculture.git
```
