# Scientific Collaboration</br>through the lens of</br>Social Network Analysis

### Ottawa Graph meetup</br>Caroline Mimeault & Mike Williamson</br>July 2017

???
This presentation was prepared for the Ottawa Graph Meetup for the July 2017 meeting. The invitation to the members included the following description: This month Caroline Mimeault will be sharing her dive into applying Social Network Analysis to data extracted from the 2015 Canadian aquaculture research and development review. She'll be looking at the connection between innovation and collaboration, and exploring what graphs can tell us about scientific collaboration. Hope to see you all there!

## Social Network Analysis (SNA):

* Process of investigating social structures through the use of networks 
* A network is a collection of points (nodes) joined together in pairs by lines (edges)
* Conceptualizing data as a network allows to apply multiple social network analytical tools and metrix

## Collaboration and innovation:

.collaboration_image.thirty[![image](images/collaboration.png)]
* New investments to increase scientific collaboration to foster and leverage important partnerships
* Creation of the [Office of Collaboration and Partnership](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/collaboration/office-bureau-eng.html)
at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in 2016
* Could SNA describe existing scientific collaboration and inform interventions in the scientific community?

## The (open) data source:

.seventy[![image](images/review.png)]

???
* Every two years since 2007, Fisheries and Oceans Canada publishes, in partnership with the Aquaculture Association of Canada, a compendium of the on-going aquaculture research and development projects in Canada.

* Projects include governmental, academic, industry and nongovernmental organizations

* The Aquaculture R&D Reviews provide an overview of the Canadian
aquaculture research community over the last decade

* All editions of the R&D reviews are available [online](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/sci-res/rd-eng.htm)

## The process:

.center.ninety[![image](images/flow.png)]

???
* For each project included in the 2015 Aquaculture R&D Review:
  * specific variables (category, title, funded by, co-funded by, project lead, project team, collaborators) were extracted into a structured, consistent and parsable data format (yaml)
  * a series of Python scripts were created to generate csv files from the yaml files for each collaborative project
  * csv files were imported in Gephi, a Social Network Analysis
software, for visualisations and analyses

## 2015 Canadian Aquaculture R&D network:

.sixty[![image](images/graph_all.png)]

???
- Nodes represent organizations: the size of the nodes represent the degree centrality, i.e., the bigger the
node, the more connections to other nodes

- Edges represent collaborative project: the weight, or thickness, of the edge, represent the number of
collaborative projects between organisations

- Total of 168 projects, 203 nodes, 616 edges

- Observations about the structure of the network(s): 
  - total of 3 independant networks (disconnected communities);
  - has a main player (DFO); 
  - contains subnetworks (sub-communities);
  - edges of various weights (some higher bandwidth connections)

- SNA metrics:
  - density: 0.03;
  - degree range: 1 to 129;
  - average degree: 6;
  - edge weight: 1 to 12
  - betweenness centrality range: 0 to above 14,000

## Network metrics of interest for innovation:

### Betweenness centrality (the usual suspect)

* The extent to which a node lies on paths between other nodes (adapted from Newman 2010)
* High betweenness nodes are often called a broker or a bridge

.quote[Being in the bridging position allows for the introduction of new and diverse information (Hill, 2008)]

.quote[Brokerage provides benefits for the individual based on the idea that non-redundant actors are sources of unique information that can be used by the broker for personal advantage by increasing their social capital (Long et al. 2013)]

.quote[... the bridging position a researcher holds in a scientific network that matters most to improve scientific performance (productivity and influence) (Contandriopoulos et al. 2016)]



???
* Loosely described, the betweenness centrality of a node is the number of times that any actor needs a given actor to reach any other actor (Borgatti and Everett al. 2005).
* The essence of any betweenness measure: the potential for withholding flow, otherwise known as gatekeeping (Borgatti and Everett, 2005)
* Brokerage provides benefits for the individual based on the idea that non-redundant actors are sources of unique information that can be used by the broker for personal advantage by increasing their social capital [5]. Social capital is defined as the advantage created by a person’s location in a structure of relationships [6, 12] and contrasts with the idea of human capital [5, 13] which explains a person’s advantage in terms of personal attributes. Brokers can facilitate access to novel information, or resources, facilitate transfer of knowledge, and co-ordinate effort across the network. Boundary spanning as a form of brokerage includes the idea of crossing organisational boundaries such as departments or organisations [14], or cultural boundaries such as disciplines [15] in order to exchange knowledge or mediate interactions. Brokers are considered key players in that their loss from a network would greatly affect its function and viability

.quote[However, position alone does not tell the full story. Our empirical findings clearly indicate that exploration success also depends on the other two dimensions of embeddedness, namely technological distance and network density (Glising et al. 2008)]

class:middle

## Network metrics of interest for innovation:

### Density (the not so usual suspect)

* Measure of connectedness between members in a network (AlKuaik et al. 2016)
* It is the number of edges divided by the number possible

.quote[dense connectivity of individual clusters ensures that information introduced into a cluster will quickly reach other firms in the cluster. The multiple pathways between firms also enhance the fidelity of the information received (Schilling and Phelps 2007)]

.quote[... dense network generate trust, reciprocity norms, and a shared identity, which increase cooperation and knowledge sharing among organizations (AlKuaik et al. 2016)]

.quote[Using a logistic regression analysis, the study finds that there is a positive and significant relationship between organization’s network density and centrality with both product innovation and process innovation (AlKuaik et al. 2016)]

## Conclusions:

* In 2015, 78% (168/215) of aquaculture R&D projects in Canada were collaborative
* The overall network of Canadian aquaculture R&D is sparse (density of 0.03) and dominated by a main player (DFO) involved in 82% (138/168) of collaborations
* The subnetworks vary in density (0.10 to 0.44) and structure 
* Based on scientific literature and among Canadian aquaculture R&D networks, CIMTAN appears to have the structure most conductive for innovation

???
* In 2015, DFO was an central node in the Canadian aquaculture R&D network being involved in 64% of collaborative aquaculture R&D projects
* DFO’s position varies among networks of different research areas

## Guidance from SNA to foster scientific innovation through collaboration:

* Increase flow of knowledge and information by increasing density
* Create new edges between organisations rather than reaching out for additional organisations 

???
Study  | Conclusion(s) | To increase output(s)...
------ | ------------- | -----------------------
Schilling and Phelps 2007 | Combination of clustering and reach (density) was associated with higher firm patenting. Betweenness centrality was not | Increase density
Gilsing et al. 2007 | The value of betweenness depends on the similarity to others and on the degree of network density | Context specific
AlKuaik et al. 2016 | Significant positive relationship between organization’s network density and centrality with product and process innovation | Increase density and centrality
Contandriopoulos et al. 2016 | Bridging position (betweenness) in a network improves scientific performance (productivity and influence) 
Parise et al. 2015 | High "compactness ratio" (density) network negatively correlated with ideation
