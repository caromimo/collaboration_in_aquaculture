# Scientific Collaboration </br>through the lens of </br>Social Network Analysis

### Ottawa Graph meetup </br>Caroline Mimeault & Mike Williamson </br>July 2017

???
This month Caroline Mimeault will be sharing her dive into applying Social Network Analysis to data extracted from the 2015 Canadian aquaculture research and development review. She'll be looking at the connection between innovation and collaboration, and exploring what graphs can tell us about scientific collaboration.

Hope to see you all there!

## Aquaculture is:

???
Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms such as fish, shellfish and aquatic plants – it’s essentially agriculture, but in the water.
Source: http://www.aquaculture.ca/
Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance

Research & Development (R&D) in several fields:

Finfish: Freshwater

Finfish: Salmon

Parasite

Fish Health

Environmental Interactions

CIMTAN

Shellfish: Mussels, oysters and others

Breeding, rearing, husbandry, production, harvesting, interactions, etc.

Every day: I work in the Aquaculture Science division of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO)

## Social Network Analysis (SNA):

* Process of investigating social structures through the use of networks * A network is a collection of points (nodes) joined together in pairs by lines (edges)
* Conceptualizing data as a network allows to apply multiple social network analytical tools

???
Once a month, I come here and learn, or try to learn, pretty cool things about Social Network Analysis...

SNA: Science that studies the structure of communities providing tools to describe and measure collaboration

Took the Social Network Analysis course with Lada Adamic on Coursera, and I really enjoyed it

## Collaboration and innovation:

.collaboration_image.thirty[![image](images/collaboration.png)]
* New investments to increase scientific collaboration to foster and leverage important partnerships
* Creation of the [Office of Collaboration and Partnership](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/collaboration/office-bureau-eng.html)
at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in 2016
* Could SNA describe existing scientific collaboration and inform interventions in the scientific community?

???
A new division at work was created:
Office of Partnership and Collaboration

# Scientific collaboration in Canadian aquaculture R&D

class: center, middle

## The (open) data source:

.seventy[![image](images/review.png)]

???
* Every two years since 2007, Fisheries and Oceans Canada publishes, in partnership with the Aquaculture Association of Canada, a compendium of the on-going aquaculture research and development projects in Canada

* Projects include governmental, academic, industry and nongovernmental organizations

* The Aquaculture R&D Reviews provide an overview of the Canadian
aquaculture research community over the last decade

* All editions of the R&D reviews are available [online](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/sci-res/rd-eng.htm)

## Defining collaboration:

### Two or more organizations working on a given project, i.e. listed as project lead, project team or collaborators

---
class: middle

## The process:

.center.ninety[![image](images/flow.png)]

???
* For each project included in the 2015 Aquaculture R&D Review:
  * specific variables (category, title, funded by, co-funded by, project lead, project team, collaborators) were extracted into a structured, consistent and parsable data format (yaml)
  * a series of Python scripts were created to generate csv files from the yaml files for each collaborative project
  * csv files were imported in Gephi, a Social Network Analysis
software, for visualisations and analyses

## 2015 Canadian Aquaculture R&D network:

.sixty[![image](images/graph_all.png)]

???
- Nodes represent organizations: the size of the nodes represent the centrality, i.e., the bigger the
node, the more connections to other nodes

- Edges represent collaborative project: the weight, or thickness, of the edge, represent the number of
collaborative projects between organisations

- Total of 168 projects, 203 nodes, 616 edges

- Observations about the structure of the network(s): 
  - total of 3 independant networks (disconnected communities);
  - has a main player (DFO); 
  - contains subnetworks (sub-communities);
  - edges of various weights (some higher bandwidth connections)

- SNA metrix:
  - density: 0.03;
  - degree range: 1 to 129;
  - average degree: 6;
  - edge weight: 1 to 12

## 2015 Aquaculture R&D Review:

* 78% (168/215) of projects included in the 2015 Canadian Aquaculture R&D Review were collaborative (i.e., involved at least two organisations)
* On-going aquaculture R&D span over several topics of research

.center.sixty[![image](images/categories.png)]

???
In 2015, Fisheries and Oceans Canada was involved in 138 (64%) of the 215 projects of which 108 (78%) were collaborative

  - relatively small network with a single community; 
  - has two main players (Université Laval and University of Guelph);
  - main players represent aprroximately 5% of the total players

- SNA metrix:
  - density: 0.12;

- Observations about the structure of the network(s): 
  - relatively small network with a single community;
  - has four main players (UofV, UNB, DFO and Cooke Aquaculture involving academia, government and industry as equal contributors); 
  - main players represent approximately 22% of the total players;

  - 1150 contacts were made with 232 media outlets across 42 countries, through interviews or citations
  - diverse array of documents and media platforms (scientific papers, papers and abstracts in conference proceedings, book chapters, theses, reports, professional magazines articles, newspapers/radio/TV interviews and documentaries, public school activities, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, YouTube videos, CIMTAN Snippets newsletter, Wikipedia, etc.) 
   - reach varied targeted fields and audiences in Canada and beyond, and to spread the IMTA message widely with researchers, federal and provincial agencies, the industry, professional associations, coastal and rural communities, First Nations, national and international environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs), and the general and school public.

## Conclusions/Discussion

* In 2015, **78%** of aquaculture R&D projects in Canada were **collaborative**
* The structures of subnetworks varied (1, 2 or 4 main nodes in the network)
* The density of subnetworks varied (0.10 to 0.44)
* In 2015, DFO was an central node in the Canadian aquaculture R&D network being involved in 64% of collaborative aquaculture R&D projects
* DFO’s position varies among networks of different research areas

* Is position in network linked to performance?
* Increasing collaboration = more edges
* How many edges is enough?
* What is the targeted rate of scientific collaboration in aquaculture?
* Where should new edges be added?
** With DFO? Should DFO collaborate on more projects? This would increase DFO’s centrality measure
** Between partners? Should there be more collaboration between organisations other than DFO? This would decrease DFO’s centrality measure

As excited I, we, were to do this project, it did not take long to realise that several other people have explored this approach.

## Literature review

Study  | Level | Finding(s) | To increase output(s)...
------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------
Contandriopoulos et al. 2016 | Individual | Bridging position (betweenness) in a network improves scientific performance (productivity and influence) 
Parise et al. 2015 | Individual | High "compactness ratio" (density) network negatively correlated with ideation
Schilling and Phelps 2007 | Organizations | Combination of clustering and reach (density) was associated with higher firm patenting. Betweenness centrality was not | Increase density
Gilsing et al. 2007 | Organizations | The value of betweenness depends on the similarity to others and on the degree of network density | Depends
AlKuaik et al. 2016 | Organizations | Significant positive relationship between organization’s network density and centrality with product and process innovation | Increase density and centrality

# Part IV:
# Potential future analyses

---
class: middle

## Potential future analyses:

* Determine how aquaculture R&D networks change over time
* Determine if increased collaboration correlates with increased valuable outcomes such as publications, science advice, patents, etc.
* Determine the optimal structure of scientific collaboration (cost vs. outcomes)
* Analyse structures of funding networks
